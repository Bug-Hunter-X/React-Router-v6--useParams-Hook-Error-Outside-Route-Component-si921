In React Router Dom v6, a common error arises when attempting to access the `useParams` hook outside of a component rendered within a route.  This hook relies on the routing context, which isn't available globally.  For example, trying to use useParams in a custom hook that is then used in a component not directly under a route will result in an error. 

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const useMyParams = () => {
  const params = useParams(); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'params')
  return params;
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  const params = useMyParams();
  // ...
};
```
